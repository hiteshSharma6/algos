# Sorting
## Merge Sort
### Mergesort is a comparison-based algorithm that focuses on how to merge together two pre-sorted arrays such that the resulting array is also sorted.
	1. Worst case complexity is O(nLogn)
	2. Average case complexity is O(nlogn)
	3. Best case complexity is O(nlogn)

## Bubble Sort
### Bubble sort is a comparisonâ€‹-based algorithm thatcompares each pair of elements in an array and swaps them if they are out of order until the entire array is sorted. For each element in the list, the algorithm compares every pair of elements.
	1. Worst case complexity is O(n^2)
	2. Best case complexity is O(n)
