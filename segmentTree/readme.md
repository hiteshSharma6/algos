Segment tree is a data structure which can be used to perform range queries and range updates. The underlying principle behind this data structure is to store certain values of ranges as a balanced binary tree and hence query and update can be performed efficiently.

Building Complexity o(n)

Updating Complexity o(log n)

Querying Complexity o(log n)
